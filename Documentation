# 🪨 ROCK vs MINE Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies sonar signals as either **Rock** or **Mine**. This has real-world applications in **underwater object detection**, especially in **submarine navigation and military defense systems**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use a supervised learning algorithm to identify whether a given sonar signal returns from a **rock** or a **mine** (i.e., unexploded underwater mines).

We use the **Sonar dataset** from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29), which contains 208 patterns with 60 features each.

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Instances:** 208
* **Features:** 60 (numerical values representing energy of sonar signals)
* **Target Classes:**

  * `R` → Rock
  * `M` → Mine

---

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing values (if any)
   * Label encoding for target
   * Feature scaling using StandardScaler

2. **Modeling**

   * Split dataset into training and test sets
   * Trained using multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
   * Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

3. **Best Performing Model**

   * Selected the model with the best accuracy and generalization ability

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook
