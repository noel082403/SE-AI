This project presents an intelligent system for classifying underwater objects as either rocks or mines using sonar signal data. The system employs machine learning models to analyze sonar return patterns and predict the nature of the detected object. To enhance interpretability, the project integrates a large language model (Gemini) to provide natural language explanations of predictions. A user-friendly interface is developed using Streamlit, ensuring accessibility for non-technical users. The application is containerized with Docker for seamless deployment across different platforms. This combination of machine learning, explainable AI, and containerization offers a scalable and interpretable solution for underwater object classification, with applications in defense, marine research, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).
